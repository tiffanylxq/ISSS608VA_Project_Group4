# Introduction

The first of its kind, this term's ISSS608 Visual Analytics and
Applications course led by [Professor Kam Tin
Seong](link%20to%20about%20us%20page) builds us towards the highly
prestigious [IEEE Vast Challenge
2022](https://vast-challenge.github.io/2022/).

There are 4 challenges provided, targeting different aspects of life in
the fictional town *Engagement*. Each team is to choose one challenge to
create a visualisation solution that will be hosted on a web application
using the R package - [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/). We chose to
analyse the Economics of Engagement, and created a dashboard that allows
the user to visually analyse the interplay between employee (or
residents) and business (or employers) before delving deeply into
exploring either.

# Brief Information About Competition

are given information from *2022-03-01T00:00:00Z* to
*2022-03-04T14:25:00Z* about the 1010 participants who reside there.
