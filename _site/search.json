      "contents": "\r\nThe first of its kind, this term’s ISSS608 Visual Analytics and\r\nApplications course led by Professor Kam Tin Seong builds\r\nus towards the highly prestigious IEEE Vast Challenge\r\n2022.\r\nThere are 4 challenges provided, targeting different aspects of life\r\nin the fictional town Engagement. Each team is to choose one\r\nchallenge to create a visualisation solution that will be hosted on a\r\nweb application using the R package - Shiny. We chose to analyse the\r\nEconomics of Engagement, and created a dashboard that allows the user to\r\nvisually analyse the interplay between employee (or residents) and\r\nbusiness (or employers) before delving deeply into exploring either.\r\nBrief Information About\r\nCompetition\r\nThis year, the competition features the fictional town\r\nEngagement. We are given information from\r\n2022-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2022-03-04T14:25:00Z about the\r\n1010 participants who reside there.\r\nDatasets\r\nIn general, there are 13 datasets.\r\n\r\nDataset\r\nDescription\r\n1\r\nPa rtici pantStatusLogs\r\nA collection of 72 Comma-Separated Values (CSV) files, each\r\ncontaining information about all participants’ day-to-day activities.\r\nEach CSV file contains information about the participant’s current\r\nlocation, hunger status, sleep status, apartment, available balance,\r\njob, financial status, daily food budget and extra weekly budget.  \r\n2\r\nApartments\r\nInformation about the rental cost, max occupancy, number of rooms,\r\nand location of buildings in Engagement. \r\n3\r\nBuildings\r\nInformation about the location, types and maximum occupancy of\r\nbuildings in Engagement. \r\n4\r\nEmployers\r\nInformation about the location of employers in Engagement. \r\n5\r\nJobs\r\nInformation about employers, hourly rate, start time, end time, days\r\nto work and education requirements that employees in Engagement have to\r\nmeet. \r\n6\r\nParticipants\r\nOverarching information about each participant, including household\r\nsize, whether they have kids, age, education levels, interest groups and\r\njoviality.\r\n7\r\nPubs\r\nInformation about the hourly cost of operation, mac occupancy and\r\nlocation of pubs in Engagement.\r\n8\r\nRestaurants\r\nInformation about the cost of food, maximum occupancy and location\r\nof restaurants in Engagement. \r\n9\r\nSchools\r\nInformation about the monthly costs, maximum enrollment and location\r\nof schools in Engagement. \r\n10\r\nCheckinJournal\r\nInformation about the time participants check into different venues\r\nin Engagement.\r\n11\r\nFi nancialJournal\r\nInformation about the time and amount participants spend on certain\r\ntypes of items (ie Education, Food, Recreation, Rent Adjustment, Shelter\r\nand Wage)\r\n12\r\nSocialNetwork\r\nInformation about the interaction between 2 participants in\r\nEngagement.\r\n13\r\nTrave lJournal\r\nInformation about the all travel start and end time and duration,\r\ntheir purpose, the check-in and check-out timing associated with such\r\ntravel, and the amount a participant starts and ends off with during\r\nsuch travel. \r\nChallenges\r\nThere were 4 challenges provided. Each one asks us to choose a\r\nperspective to evaluate Engagement by.\r\nThey are:\r\nDemographics and Relationships\r\nPatterns of Life\r\nEconomic\r\nCombining analysis from Challenges 1 to 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

How are people\r\nchanging jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over\r\ntime?\r\nSub -Questions\r\n\r\n1\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500\r\nwords.\r\n2\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n3\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\r\n500 words.\r\nVisualisation Solution\r\n\r\nIn order to visualise the changes systematically, we take a\r\nmulti-prong approach. More specifically, there are 4 “prongs” — one to\r\nteach the user how to use our app, and the rest for each question.\r\nAs seen above, all 4 prongs will be parked under a unifying\r\ndashboard, with each prong being accessible by a tab. The questions will\r\nbe arranged sequentially, starting from the user menu (or introduction,\r\nSub-Question 1 (ie Business Performance), Sub-Question 2 (ie\r\nIncome and Expense) and Sub-Question 3 (ie\r\nEmployer).\r\nWe arrange our tabs in this manner because we want to guide our user\r\ninto a top-down understanding of the economy in Engagement. using the\r\nBusiness Performance tab. The user first learns about the\r\nbusiness ecosystem in Engagement. Using that information, he or she will\r\nbe able to make more informed exploratory decisions to understand the\r\nsituation from the employee, through the Income and Expense\r\ntab, and employer’s, through the Employer tab,\r\nperspectives.\r\nSub-Question 1 - Business\r\nPerformance\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear\r\nto be more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers.\r\n\r\nWe use 2 sub-tabs to answer this - Pubs & Restaurants\r\nand Workplaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pubs & Restaurants tab has 7 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA bar graph displaying the top overall performing businesses in\r\nEngagement.\r\nA line graph that shows the monthly sales of different venues over\r\ntime.\r\nA map that shows the total sales by venue id.\r\nA scatter plot demonstrating the cumulative sales by different\r\nvisitors.\r\nA violin-and-boxplot that shows the statistical distribution of\r\nweekend sales.\r\nA heatmap that displays the frequency of check-ins by days in the\r\nweek and time of the day.\r\n1. Control\r\nThe 4 features in which users can play around with are as\r\nfollows.\r\nFeature\r\nFunction\r\nCategory (Radio button)\r\nUser has the option to view either restaurants or pubs.\r\nScenario (Dropdown)\r\nUser can select the type of scenario they would like to visualize.\r\nSelect ‘Top 5’ or ‘Top 10’ to view the top 5 or top 10 businesses to see\r\nwhich companies are prospering.\r\nDate (Range Slider)\r\nUser has the ability to scope to the target range date.\r\n2. Top Overall Performing\r\nBusiness\r\nTotal Sales Chart MockupThe main objective of the first question in challenge 3 is to\r\nidentify which businesses are prospering or struggling. As there is no\r\nsales and expense data found on the Restaurants.csv and\r\nPubs.csv, the only way to obtain sales volume is to compute\r\nvia the customer’s spending on these businesses. Prosperous businesses\r\nwill refer to companies that are making more sales whereas struggling\r\nbusinesses will refer to companies that have lower sales. As the sales\r\nvolume fluctuates sporadically day-to-day, to determine the top 5\r\ncompanies, the total overall sales are calculated and the 5 companies\r\nwith the most sales are selected.\r\n3. Monthly Sales\r\nMonthly Sales MockupAs the Total Sales Chart only compares at the overall sales\r\nvolume, it provides no insights on how the businesses are performing\r\novertime. Therefore, the Monthly Sales chart visualizes how the\r\ncompanies are performing at a monthly basis. We see that in general,\r\nthere is a sharp decline in sales from March 2022 to April 2022.\r\nBusinesses continues to dip till June 2022 after which the sales\r\nfluctuates.\r\n4. Total Sales by VenueId\r\n\r\n**Please fill in.\r\n5. Cumulative Sales By\r\nCumulative Visitors\r\n\r\n**Please fill in.\r\n6. Distribution of Weekly\r\nSales\r\nAverage Spending of Customers Chart\r\nMockupTo give insights to users on the weekday sales of the selected\r\nbusinesses. Are customers spending more on the weekday or the\r\nweekends?\r\n7. Check-in By Weekday and\r\nTime of Day\r\nOccupancy Heatmap Chart\r\nMockupThe Occupancy Heatmap provides vizualisation on the average occupancy\r\nrate for the selected company across the weekdays at hourly intervals.\r\nUsers are able to see which are the peak and non-peak periods.\r\nTab 2 - Workplaces\r\n\r\nThe Workplaces tab has 3 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA bar graph displaying the total wages paid by an employer.\r\nA line graph that shows the monthly total wages paid by an employer\r\nover time.\r\n1. Control\r\n\r\n** Please fill in\r\n2. Bar Graph of Total Wages\r\n\r\n** Please fill in.\r\n3. Line Chart of Monthly\r\nTotal Wages\r\n\r\n** Please fill in.\r\nSub-Question 2\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n We use 3 sub-tabs to answer\r\nthis - Income and Expense, Patterns with Heatmap and\r\nParticipant Breakdown.\r\nTab 1 - Income and Expense\r\n\r\nThe Income and Expense tab has 7 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA line graph for Engagement.\r\nA line graph for an individual.\r\nA violin plot for Engagement.\r\nA violin plot for individual.\r\n1. Control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 parts to the controller. The first part allows me to\r\nselect the time range, as well as the time divisions (daily, weekly etc)\r\nto be used for evaluation.\r\nThe second one allows us to decide what income and expense to\r\nevaluate for Engagement. On top of that, it allows us to evaluate the\r\ntotal, average, maximum and minimum value for each time division.\r\nThe last one allows the user to evaulate an individual participant’s\r\nincome and expenses. This allows us to either evaluate the individual\r\nalone, or compare him or her to the general performance in\r\nEngagement.\r\n2 + 3. Line Graphs\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to track subtle differences in income, total\r\nexpenses and sub-expenses over time and answers the first 2\r\nsub-questions.\r\n4 + 5. Violin Plots\r\n\r\nWhile the line graph is great, it does not encapsulate any\r\nstatistical information. \r\nWe gather such information for the chosen income and expenses for\r\nboth Engagement and the individual chosen with a violin plot. This way,\r\nwe get to see the distribution, as well as the mean and variance in the\r\ndifferent parameters.\r\nTab 2 -Patterns with Heatmap\r\nThe Patterns with\r\nHeatmap tab has 2 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA heatmap representing the balance of individuals in\r\nEngagement.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe controller allows us to choose the date range and the time\r\ndivision to evaluate. In order to seek a “pattern”, we let the user rank\r\nthe participants based on a certain factor. The user can do this\r\nascendingly or descendingly. Lastly, we allow the user to explore\r\ndifferent ranges of people, from the top 50 all the way to the 237th\r\nmember ranked.\r\n2 - Heatmap\r\n\r\nEach row in the heat map represents a participant. Each column in the\r\nheat map represents a time period. To adjust the number of participants\r\nin the heat map, we can use the “Top X filter” in the Heat Map\r\nController. \r\nMore importantly, the magnitude of the colour is representative of\r\nthe amount of balance or debt. For example, a participant with more debt\r\nin a certain time period will have a denser red-coloured grid than a\r\nuser with less debt.\r\nTab 3 -Participant Breakdown\r\n\r\nThe Participant Breakdown tab has 2 large parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nMay other barplots that represent the basic traits of the\r\nparticipants chosen in the previous heatmap.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe barplots will naturally changes according to the decisions we\r\nmade in the previous heatmap. We also allow the user to customise the\r\ngroup of people he or she wants to evaluate by letting them manually\r\ninput the id of those participants.\r\n2 - Barplots\r\nof Traits Representative of Participant\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heatmap is helpful for pattern recognition. The traits\r\nhighlighted here allow us to explain those patterns.\r\nSub-Question 3\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city\r\nlimits. What employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas\r\nof particularly high or low turnover?\r\n\r\nWe use 3 sub-tabs to answer this - Map View, Hiring Rate and\r\nTurnover Rate.\r\nTab 1 - Map View\r\n\r\nThe Income and Expense tab has 7 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA map that shows the location and number of employees employed by\r\nthe employer.\r\nA database with information on each employer.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe user is allowed to choose the type of employer to evaulate.\r\n2 - Map\r\n\r\nWe then display a map of the city, and the number of employers in\r\neach company. This way, the user might be able to look beyond the\r\ncompany and see how different employers interact.\r\n3 - Data\r\n\r\nExtra data is provided to help the user find patterns.\r\nTab 2 - Hiring Rate\r\nTab 3 - Turnover Rate\r\nProposed Packages\r\nThese are the R packages we are planning on using. This is subject to\r\nchange as the requirements of the project from our end might change.\r\nPackage Name\r\nUse \r\nshiny and shiny dashboard\r\nTo build an interactive web visualisation.\r\nshinythemes\r\nTo make our shiny website more aesthetic.\r\ntidyverse\r\nA must-have for data manipulation and exploration.\r\nplotly\r\nTo create all bar charts and graphs. \r\nggplot2\r\nTo plot our visualisations and conduct Exploratory Data\r\nAnalysis. \r\ntreemap\r\nTo display hierarchical data as a set of nested rectangles. \r\nggrepel \r\nTo repel overlapping text labels away from each other and away from\r\nthe data points that they label.\r\nlubridate\r\nTo make it easier to work with dates and times.\r\ngapminder\r\n\r\ngganimate\r\nTo create animated ggplots. \r\nggiraph \r\nTo create dynamic ggplot graphs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
