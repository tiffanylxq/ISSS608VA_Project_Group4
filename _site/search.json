Are standards of living improving or declining over time? How are people changing jobs?\r\n\r\n\r\nData Preparation\r\nWe use 11 of 13 data sets: Participant StatusLogs, Apartments, Buildings, Employers, Jobs, Participants, Pubs, Restaurants, Schools, CheckinJournal and TravelJournal that is charted from 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2023-05-24T04:30:00Z for all 1010 participants who reside in Engagement. Our goal is to sieve out the key data points related to each of the questions mentioned above.\r\nTo do that, tidyverse, dplyr, lubridate packages etc are used to prepare the datasets which are then saved into RDS or CSV formats in order to make retrieval easier. Lastly, we use the packages plotly, ggplot2, tmap, sf, rPackedBar, gt, and gtExtras etc to create data visualizations.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n\r\nTab 1 - ‘Business Performance’\r\nIn assessing which businesses within the city of Engagement are thriving, we consider two approaches by using the revenue generated and wages offered. Pubs and restaurants are two distinct businesses with participant’s expenses data available. As such, the performance of pubs and restaurants is evaluated based on the accumulated sales. On the other hand, as wages are the only numeric data present for all employers, it will be the basis for comparing the financial prosperity of the employers.\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Business Performance’ tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) By Revenue and (2) By Wages.\r\n(1) By Revenue Under the By Revenue section it is further divided into 2 sub-tabs, Overview and Deep Dive.\r\nThe Overview sub-tab provides an overall glance of the business performance of pubs and restaurants. Users first select either pubs or restaurants to see the ranking in terms of overall sales based on the filtered duration. The data found on the right part of the dashboard provides further insights on the sales performance of each business that falls under the selected category of pubs or restaurants arranged based on the average monthly sales in descending order. Users can also observe the monthly trend of each business through the sparklines available. Meanwhile, the map plot illuminates areas of the town where businesses are flourishing.\r\n\r\nBy Revenue (Overview) Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\nThe Deep Dive section allows user to explore on the sales performance of a selected business across the weekdays. In general, we observe that pubs tend to have higher sales and more visitors during the weekends. On the other hand, the heatmap plot reveals the peak timings of the ‘Venue ID’ selected.\r\n\r\nBy Revenue (Deep Dive) Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\n(2) By Wages Users have the option to compare the average wages of the employers by filtering the education level. The packed bar charts showcase the top employers that offers the 10 highest average hourly wage by education level. The box plot depicts the distribution of the average hourly wage of all employers. User can select the points on the box plot to obtain additional details of the selected businesses such as the number of jobs offered for that particular education level.\r\n\r\nBy Wage Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTab 2 - ‘Employees’\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Employees’ tab, the user can further select 3 components to explore. They are (1) Income and Expense, (2) Patterns with Heatmap and (3) Participant Breakdown.\r\n(1) Income and Expense This tab starts the user off with a bird’s eye view of Engagement’s income and expenses over time. To do so, a line graph over time and allow the user to pick from 4 settings, “total”, “average”, “maximum” and “minimum”, that provide the data that their names suggest. The user can then explore different participants individually with a degree of granularity. Both charts are placed side by side to make it easier for the user to compare the information. Violin plots are provided below both line graphs so that the users can understand the distribution and key statistical parts, such as average and spread, of both line graphs in an instance.\r\n\r\nIncome and Expense Dashboard\r\n\r\n(2) Patterns with Heatmap A person’s balance determines his or her financial health, and that is the base data set for this tab. The easiest way to find a pattern would be use a clustering algorithm on that data set, as demonstrated by the Clustered Heatmap of Residents in Engagement. To enhance instant explanability and derive preliminary results from the dashboard, user can also explore potential patterns throught the Ranked Heatmap of Residents in Engagement. when the participants are ranked based on their income, expense and balance.\r\n\r\nPatterns with Heatmap Dashboard\r\n\r\n(3) Participant Breakdown This tab provides the user with a quick overview of the personal information of participants he or she chooses either from the Patterns with Heatmap tab or by manually inputting up to 10 participant IDs to help explain the patterns observed.\r\n\r\nParticipant Breakdown Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTab 3 - ‘Employers’\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Employers’ tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) Map View and (2) Turnover Rate.\r\n(1) Overview of Employers’ Health This tab allows users to study the employment numbers of all the employers in the city throughout the different selected time period. The map shows the locations of each employer and number of employees they employed while the statistical plot aims to show the distribution of the number of employees with the user selected variable. A datatable is also provided for user to understand further information of the selected employer. Various parameters (eg. hourly rate, hiring rate etc) are available for users to understand further each employer’s health.\r\n\r\nEmployer Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\nEmployer Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\n(2) Turnover Rate This tab zooms down to employees that have changed jobs and employers that have changed employees during the 15 month data collection period. The charts separate the employees into different education levels and whether they have kids. The statistical plots aims to allow users to generate insights on relations of other factors to turnover rate.\r\n\r\nEmployer Tab Dashboard\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work and Conclusion\r\nGiven more data, we could have minimized the need to hypothesize and triangulate. For example, business expenses information would allow us to more accurately determine the growth of a business by comparing the profits and losses over time. Also, while the user guide and poster are useful, it would be best if we could present and demonstrate our solution in person as the former methods do not allow us to cater for and explain all the edge cases.\r\nThat being said, we believe that our solution paints a congruent enough information about the macro and granular details of the economy and its stakeholders, and would help the user understand the economy of Engagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

How are people\r\nchanging jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over\r\ntime?\r\nSub -Questions\r\n\r\n1\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500\r\nwords.\r\n2\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n3\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\r\n500 words.\r\nVisualisation Solution\r\n\r\nIn order to visualise the changes systematically, we take a\r\nmulti-prong approach. More specifically, there are 4 “prongs” — one to\r\nteach the user how to use our app, and the rest for each question.\r\nAs seen above, all 4 prongs will be parked under a unifying\r\ndashboard, with each prong being accessible by a tab. The questions will\r\nbe arranged sequentially, starting from the user menu (or introduction,\r\nSub-Question 1 (ie Business Performance), Sub-Question 2 (ie\r\nEmployee) and Sub-Question 3 (ie Employer).\r\nWe arrange our tabs in this manner to guide user into a top-down\r\nunderstanding of the economy in Engagement. The user first learns about\r\nthe business ecosystem in Engagement using the Business\r\nPerformance tab. Using that information, user will be able to make\r\ninformed exploratory decisions to understand the situation from the\r\nemployee, through the Income and Expense tab, and employer’s,\r\nthrough the Employer tab, perspectives.\r\nBusiness Performance\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear\r\nto be more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers.\r\n\r\nWe use 2 sub-tabs to answer this - By Revenue and By\r\nWages.\r\nThe ‘By Revenue (Overview)’\r\nTab\r\n‘By Revenue (Overview)’ TabThis tab has 4 parts:\r\nThe controller that allows the user to:\r\nSelect a category, either Pubs or Restaurants\r\nSelect Date Range, for filtering the period of interest\r\n\r\nA bar graph displaying the ranking of businesses by total revenue in\r\nthe city of Engagement.\r\nA data table and sparklines that shows the monthly sales trend of\r\nbusinesses over time.\r\nA map that shows the total sales by venue id.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nUser has the option to view either ‘Pubs’ or ‘Restaurants’. This\r\ncontrol will alter all 3 charts found within the pane.\r\nUser can scope to the interested date range. This control will\r\nalter all 3 charts found within the pane.\r\n2 - Top Overall Performing\r\nBusiness\r\nBusiness Performance RankingThe Business Performance Ranking By Total Revenue\r\nbar chart arranges the ‘venueId’ based on the total revenue generated in\r\ndescending order. User can identify the performing and struggling\r\nbusinesses. User can also hover over the bar charts to obtain the total\r\nrevenue amount for each business.\r\n3 - Monthly Sales Trend\r\nand Distribution\r\nMonthly Sales TrendAs the businesses in the Business Performance Ranking\r\nChart are compared based on the overall sales accumulated, it\r\nprovides little insights on how the businesses are performing over time.\r\nThus, the data table and sparklines chart is displayed to reveal the\r\nmonthly sales trend and provide the lowest and the highest revenue\r\ngenerated.\r\n4 - Business Performance by\r\nLocation\r\nBusiness Performance by\r\nLocationThe map plot allows the user to explore and identify if there are any\r\npatterns in terms of business performance based on the location of the\r\npubs or restaurants. The user also has the ability to zoom in and out of\r\nthe plot as well as hover onto the circles to identify the ‘venue ID’\r\nand the total sales collected.\r\nThe ‘By Revenue (Deep Dive)’\r\nTab\r\n‘By Revenue (Deep Dive)’ TabThis tab has 3 parts:\r\nThe controller that allows the user to:\r\nSelect a particular company of interest\r\nSelect parameters for the box plot.\r\n\r\nA violin-and-box plot that shows the statistical distribution of\r\ndaily sales across the weekdays.\r\nA heatmap that displays the frequency of check-ins by days in the\r\nweek and time of the day.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nUser has the option to view either ‘Pubs’ or ‘Restaurants’. This\r\ncontrol will alter both charts found within the pane.\r\nUser can deep dive for a particular venueId or company of\r\ninterest. This control will alter both charts found within the\r\npane.\r\nUser can select the type of box-plot that they would like to\r\nview. This is only applicable to the Distribution of Daily Sales\r\nby Weekday chart.\r\nUser can select the type of statistical test in comparing the\r\ndifference in sales between 2 weekdays. This is only applicable to the\r\nDistribution of Daily Sales by Weekday chart.\r\nUser can select the type of pairwise display for the box plot.\r\nThis is only applicable to the Distribution of Daily Sales by\r\nWeekday chart.\r\nUser can select the type of P-Adjust methods for the box plot.\r\nThis is only applicable to the Distribution of Daily Sales by\r\nWeekday chart.\r\n2 - Distribution of\r\nDaily Sales by Weekday\r\nAverage Spending of Customers\r\nChartUsers can compare the daily sales amount across on the weekdays.\r\n3 - Check-in By Weekday and\r\nTime of Day\r\nAverage Check-in Heatmap\r\nChartThe Average Check-In by Weekday and Time of the Day\r\nheatmap provides visualization on the average visitors for the selected\r\ncompany across the weekdays at hourly intervals. The chart can be used\r\nto examine the peak and non-peak periods of the selected businesses.\r\nUser can also hover over the heatmap to view the average number of\r\nvisitors at a selected hour.\r\nThe ‘By Wages’ Tab\r\n“By Wages’ TabThis tab has 4 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to:\r\nSelect the education level\r\n\r\nA packed bar chart displaying the arrangement of businesses in\r\ndescending values of average hourly wage.\r\nA box plot that shows the distribution of the average hourly wage of\r\nall employers.\r\nA data table that displays the ‘venueId’, number of jobs, average\r\nhourly wage and total hourly wage details.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nUser can filter based on the ‘Education Level’. This control applies\r\nto all of the 3 charts found within the pane.\r\n2 - Packed Bar Chart of\r\nAverage Hourly Wage\r\nAverage Hourly Wage Packed Bar\r\nChartThe top 10 employers that offer the highest average hourly wage are\r\nhighlighted in blue. Users can hover over the bar chart to view the\r\nemployer ID and the average hourly wage offered by the respective\r\nemployer.\r\n3 -\r\nBox-plot Depicting the Distribution of Average Hourly Wage\r\nDistribution of Average Hourly Wage by\r\nEmployerUsers can hover over the box plot and data points to view the average\r\nhourly wage offered.Users can also select the data points to reveal more\r\ndetails on the selected points.\r\n4 - Data Table\r\nBoxplot with Data Points\r\nSelectedData TableWhen a user selects a set of data points from the\r\nDistribution of Average Hourly Wage by Employer a data\r\ntable appears showing information on employer ID, number of jobs,\r\naverage hourly pay and total hourly pay.\r\nEmployees\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n We use 3 sub-tabs to answer\r\nthis - Income and Expense, Patterns with Heatmap and\r\nParticipant Breakdown.\r\nThe ‘Income and Expense’ Tab\r\n\r\nThis has 7 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA line graph for Engagement.\r\nA line graph for an individual.\r\nA violin plot for Engagement.\r\nA violin plot for individual.\r\n1. Control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 parts to the controller. The first part allows me to\r\nselect the time range, as well as the time divisions (daily, weekly etc)\r\nto be used for evaluation.\r\nThe second one allows us to decide what income and expense to\r\nevaluate for Engagement. On top of that, it allows us to evaluate the\r\ntotal, average, maximum and minimum value for each time division.\r\nThe last one allows the user to evaluate an individual participant’s\r\nincome and expenses. This allows us to either evaluate the individual\r\nalone, or compare him or her to the general performance in\r\nEngagement.\r\n2 + 3. Line Graphs\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to track subtle differences in income, total\r\nexpenses and sub-expenses over time and answers the first 2\r\nsub-questions.\r\n4 + 5. Violin Plots\r\n\r\nWhile the line graph is great, it does not encapsulate any\r\nstatistical information. \r\nWe gather such information for the chosen income and expenses for\r\nboth Engagement and the individual chosen with a violin plot. This way,\r\nwe get to see the distribution, as well as the mean and variance in the\r\ndifferent parameters.\r\nThe ‘Patterns with Heatmap’\r\nTab\r\nThe Patterns with\r\nHeatmap tab has 2 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\n2 heatmaps representing the balance of individuals in Engagement - a\r\nRanking Heatmap and a Clustering Heatmap.\r\n1 - Control\r\nThere are 3 parts to the controller.\r\n\r\nThe first part allows us to choose the date range and the time\r\ndivision to evaluate. We also allow the user to explore different ranges\r\nof people, from the top 50 all the way to the 237th member.\r\n\r\nThe second part controls for the Ranking Heatmap. In order to seek a\r\n“pattern”, we let the user rank the participants based on a certain\r\nfactor. The user can do this ascendingly or descendingly.\r\n\r\nThe last part controls for the Clustering Heatmap.\r\nFirstly, we allow the user to normalize the data since this can\r\nimprove the accuracy and visibility of our data set.\r\nIn order not to clutter up the heatmap, we let the user remove and\r\nadd the x-axis and y-axis labels.\r\nThe user can choose the distance method and clustering method, and\r\ncan also choose to cluster by either the rows or the columns of the\r\nheatmap, or both.\r\nLastly, we allow the user to sort the dendogram in order to get a\r\nbetter understanding of the clusters that happen in the data set.\r\n2 - Heatmap\r\nRanking Heatmap\r\n\r\nEach row in the heat map represents a participant. Each column in the\r\nheat map represents a time period. To adjust the number of participants\r\nin the heat map, we can use the “Top X filter” in the Heat Map\r\nController. \r\nMore importantly, the magnitude of the colour is representative of\r\nthe amount of balance or debt. For example, a participant with more debt\r\nin a certain time period will have a denser red-coloured grid than a\r\nuser with less debt.\r\nClustering Heatmap\r\n\r\nWe use this in the case where the previous heatmap does not allow us\r\nto determine a good enough pattern.\r\nEach row in the heat map represents a participant. Each column in the\r\nheat map represents a time period. Using the dendograms, the user can\r\nfind interesting clusters by hovering over the zone, and find out more\r\nabout them by inputting their values in the Participant\r\nBreakdown tab.\r\nThe ‘Employee Breakdown’ Tab\r\n\r\nThe Employee Breakdown tab has 2 large parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nMay other barplots that represent the basic traits of the\r\nparticipants chosen in the previous heatmap.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe barplots will naturally changes according to the decisions we\r\nmade in the previous heatmap. We also allow the user to customise the\r\ngroup of people he or she wants to evaluate by letting them manually\r\ninput the id of those participants.\r\n2 - Barplots\r\nof Traits Representative of Participant\r\n\r\n\r\nThe heatmap is helpful for pattern recognition. The traits\r\nhighlighted here allow us to explain those patterns.\r\nEmployer\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city\r\nlimits. What employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas\r\nof particularly high or low turnover?\r\n\r\nWe use 2 sub-tabs to answer this - Map View and Turnover\r\nRate.\r\nThe ‘Map View’ Tab\r\n‘Overall View of ’Map View’\r\nTab’This tab has 4 parts.\r\nThe controller with 11 parameters that allows the user to interact\r\nwith the map, plot and data table.\r\nA map that shows the location and number of employees employed by\r\nthe employer.\r\nA plot that shows distribution of employees employed by each\r\nemployer with a selected factor.\r\nA datatable with information on each employer such as the number of\r\nemployees and jobs they have, the pay ranges and hiring rate.\r\n1 - Control\r\n The entire tab will be updated\r\naccordingly to the parameters chosen. If there is no data from the\r\nselected parameters, an error message will be reflected:\r\n\r\nUser can choose ‘Daily’, ‘Weekly’, ‘Monthly’ or ‘Weekday’ time\r\nperiod to view, the default selection is ‘Weekly’.\r\nUser can select the range or specific number of employees\r\nemployed by each employer, the default selection is to show all\r\nemployees under each employer.\r\nUser can select the range or specific number of jobs offered by\r\neach employer.\r\nUser can select the hiring rate of each employer. Hiring rate is\r\ndefined as the Number of Employees Employed divide by Number of Jobs\r\nOffered.\r\nThis shows the minimum, maximum, average and median hourly rate\r\npay across all jobs under each employer. User can choose the\r\ncomputation; the default selection is average pay.\r\nUser can select the pay group category, the default selection is\r\nto show all groups.\r\nThis control the y variable of the statistical plot which is\r\ndefaulted at the “Number of Jobs offered by each employer”, the x\r\nvariable is fixed at the number of employees employed by each\r\nemployer.\r\nUser can specify the statistical test that he/she wishes to see.\r\nThe default selection is parametic test.\r\nUser can specify the type of plot he/she wishes to see for the\r\nstatistical plot.The default selection is box-violin plot.\r\nUser can filter the entire tab based on ‘EmployerId’. To see more\r\nthan one employer, user is to add a comma after each ID eg.\r\n379,862,884.\r\nUser can key in any text which will be auto updated as title\r\nabove the map.\r\n2 - Map\r\nA map of the city is displayed on the left, with a legend showing the\r\nnumber of employers in each company. User can hover to the bubbles to\r\nsee the respective employerId. This way, the user might be able to look\r\nbeyond the company and see how different employers interact.\r\nOn the right is the statistical plot that shows the distribution of\r\nnumber of the employees employed.\r\n\r\n3 - Data table\r\nUser can filter the table via the input field at the bottom of each\r\ncolumn. This serves to provide more information to help the user find\r\npatterns.\r\n\r\nThe ‘Turnover Rate’ tab\r\nThis tab has 3 parts.\r\nThe controller with 7 parameters that allow user to filter the\r\nplots.\r\nThe facet plots that classified the employees into different\r\neducational level and show whether they have kids.\r\nThe statistical plot that shows distribution of selected\r\nvariables.\r\nThe datasets used for this tab are already filtered to only 1)\r\nemployers with the number of different employees and 2) employees that\r\nhas more than one employer during the 15 month data collection\r\nperiod.\r\n‘Overall View of ’Turnover Rate’\r\nTab’1 - Control\r\n\r\nUser can choose the ‘Date’, ‘Week’ or ‘Month’ or ‘Weekday’ to see\r\nthe time period where there are changes to the\r\nemployees/employers.\r\nUser can further refine to specific time period eg. specific\r\ndate, week number or month to see the change to the\r\nemployees/employers.\r\nUser can choose the x and y variable of the statistical plot. The\r\ndefault selection is “Educational Level” as x variable and “Joviality”\r\nas y variable.\r\nUser can specify the statistical test that he/she wishes to see.\r\nThe default selection is parametic test.\r\nUser can specify the type of plot he/she wishes to see for the\r\nstatistical plot.The default selection is box-violin plot.\r\nUser can key in any text and click the “Update Title” button to\r\ncustomize the page title.\r\n2 - Plots\r\nThe plots displayed on the left shows employers with the number of\r\ndifferent employees during the selected time period.\r\n The plots displayed on the\r\nright shows employees that has more than one employer during the\r\nselected time period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
