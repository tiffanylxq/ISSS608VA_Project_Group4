Our team chose to analyse the Economics of Engagement, and created an interactive dashboard that allows the user to visually analyse the interplay between employee (or residents) and business (or employers) in order to answer the questions: Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over time?\r\n\r\n\r\nData Preparation\r\nThis year, the competition features the fictional town Engagement. We are given a total of 13 datasets comprising information from 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2022-03-04T14:25:00Z about the 1010 participants who reside there. The team used 10 of these datasets for this project, and they are Participant StatusLogs, Apartments, Buildings, Employers, Jobs, Participants, Pubs, Restaurants, Schools and CheckinJournal.\r\nWe performed data wrangling and transformation to the datasets before loading them in the application.\r\n\r\n\r\nMethodology\r\nThe application uses various packages such as tidyverse, plotly, ggplot2, lubridate, tmap, sf packages to conduct exploratory data analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\nThe app consist of three tabs for users to explore the economy of Engagement City; (1) Business Perfomance, (2) Employees and (3) Employers.\r\n\r\nTab 1 - ‘Business Performance’\r\nIn assessing which businesses within the city of Engagement are thriving, we consider two approaches by using the revenue generated and wages offered. Pubs and restaurants are two distinct businesses with participant’s expenses data available. As such, the performance of pubs and restaurants are evaluated based on the accumulated sales. On the other hand, as wages are the only numeric data present for all employers, it will be the basis in comparing the financial prosperity of the employers.\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Business Performance’ tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) By Revenue and (2) By Wages.\r\n(1) By Revenue\r\nUnder the By Revenue section it is further divided into 2 sub-tabs, Overview and Deep Dive.\r\nTheOverview sub-tab provides an overall glance of the business performance of pubs and restaurants. Users first select either pubs or restaurants to see the ranking in terms of overall sales based on the duration filtered. The data found to the right of the dashboard provides further insights on the sales performance of each business that falls under the selected category of pubs or restaurants arranged based on the average monthly sales in descending order. Users can also observe the monthly trend of each business through the sparklines available. Additionally, the map plot illuminates areas of the town where pubs or restaurants are flourishing.\r\n\r\nBy Revenue (Overview) Tab Visualisation Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTab 2 - ‘Employees’\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Employees’ tab, the user can further select 3 components to explore. They are (1) Income and Expense, (2) Patterns with Heatmap and (2) Participant Breakdown.\r\n\r\n\r\nTab 3 - ‘Employers’\r\nUpon clicking on the ‘Employers’ tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) Map View and (2) Turnover Rate.\r\n(1) Overview of Employers’ Health Users can study the employment numbers throughout different time period of all the employers in the city via the map and datatable. The map shows the locations of each employer and number of employees they employed. The statistical plot aims to show the distribution of the number of employees with the user selected variable.\r\n\r\nEmployer-Employee Tab Visualisation Chart\r\n\r\n(2) Turnover Rate This tab zoomed down to employees that have changed jobs and employers that have changed employees during the 15 month data collection period. The charts separate the employees into different education levels and whether they have kids. The statistical plots aims to allow users to generate insights on relations of other factors to turnover rate.\r\n\r\nEmployer-Employee Tab Visualisation Chart\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFuture Work and Conclusion\r\nA limitation identified by the team is the lack of data to better assess the health of businesses. Given more information, such as business expenses, it would enable the team to accurately determine the growth of a business by comparing the profits and losses over time.\r\nTry posterdown out!

How are people\r\nchanging jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over\r\ntime?\r\nSub -Questions\r\n\r\n1\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear to\r\nbe more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers. Limit your response to 10 images and 500\r\nwords.\r\n2\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n3\r\nDescribe the health of the various employers within the city limits.\r\nWhat employment patterns do you observe? Do you notice any areas of\r\nparticularly high or low turnover? Limit your response to 10 images and\r\n500 words.\r\nVisualisation Solution\r\n\r\nIn order to visualise the changes systematically, we take a\r\nmulti-prong approach. More specifically, there are 4 “prongs” — one to\r\nteach the user how to use our app, and the rest for each question.\r\nAs seen above, all 4 prongs will be parked under a unifying\r\ndashboard, with each prong being accessible by a tab. The questions will\r\nbe arranged sequentially, starting from the user menu (or introduction,\r\nSub-Question 1 (ie Business Performance), Sub-Question 2 (ie\r\nEmployee) and Sub-Question 3 (ie Employer).\r\nWe arrange our tabs in this manner to guide user into a top-down\r\nunderstanding of the economy in Engagement. The user first learns about\r\nthe business ecosystem in Engagement using the Business\r\nPerformance tab. Using that information, user will be able to make\r\ninformed exploratory decisions to understand the situation from the\r\nemployee, through the Income and Expense tab, and employer’s,\r\nthrough the Employer tab, perspectives.\r\nBusiness Performance\r\nOver the period covered by the dataset, which businesses appear\r\nto be more prosperous? Which appear to be struggling? Describe your\r\nrationale for your answers.\r\n\r\nWe use 2 sub-tabs to answer this - By Revenue and By\r\nWages.\r\nThe ‘By Revenue’ Tab\r\nThis tab has 7 parts:\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA bar graph displaying the top overall performing businesses in\r\nEngagement.\r\nA line graph that shows the monthly sales of different venues over\r\ntime.\r\nA map that shows the total sales by venue id.\r\nA scatter plot demonstrating the cumulative sales by different\r\nvisitors.\r\nA violin-and-boxplot that shows the statistical distribution of\r\nweekend sales.\r\nA heatmap that displays the frequency of check-ins by days in the\r\nweek and time of the day.\r\n1. Control\r\nThe 4 features in which users can play around with are as\r\nfollows.\r\nFeature\r\nFunction\r\nCategory (Radio button)\r\nUser has the option to view either restaurants or pubs.\r\nScenario (Dropdown)\r\nUser can select the type of scenario they would like to visualize.\r\nSelect ‘Top 5’ or ‘Top 10’ to view the top 5 or top 10 businesses to see\r\nwhich companies are prospering.\r\nDate (Range Slider)\r\nUser has the ability to scope to the target range date.\r\n2. Top Overall Performing\r\nBusiness\r\nTotal Sales Chart MockupThe main objective of the first question in challenge 3 is to\r\nidentify which businesses are prospering or struggling. As there is no\r\nsales and expense data found on the Restaurants.csv and\r\nPubs.csv, the only way to obtain sales volume is to compute\r\nvia the customer’s spending on these businesses. Prosperous businesses\r\nwill refer to companies that are making more sales whereas struggling\r\nbusinesses will refer to companies that have lower sales. As the sales\r\nvolume fluctuates sporadically day-to-day, to determine the top 5\r\ncompanies, the total overall sales are calculated and the 5 companies\r\nwith the most sales are selected.\r\n3. Monthly Sales\r\nMonthly Sales MockupAs the Total Sales Chart only compares at the overall sales\r\nvolume, it provides no insights on how the businesses are performing\r\novertime. Therefore, the Monthly Sales chart visualizes how the\r\ncompanies are performing at a monthly basis. We see that in general,\r\nthere is a sharp decline in sales from March 2022 to April 2022.\r\nBusinesses continues to dip till June 2022 after which the sales\r\nfluctuates.\r\n4. Total Sales by VenueId\r\n\r\n**Please fill in.\r\n5. Cumulative Sales By\r\nCumulative Visitors\r\n\r\n**Please fill in.\r\n6. Distribution of Weekly\r\nSales\r\nAverage Spending of Customers Chart\r\nMockupTo give insights to users on the weekday sales of the selected\r\nbusinesses. Are customers spending more on the weekday or the\r\nweekends?\r\n7. Check-in By Weekday and\r\nTime of Day\r\nOccupancy Heatmap Chart\r\nMockupThe Occupancy Heatmap provides vizualisation on the average occupancy\r\nrate for the selected company across the weekdays at hourly intervals.\r\nUsers are able to see which are the peak and non-peak periods.\r\nThe ‘By Wages’ Tab\r\n\r\nThis tab has 3 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA bar graph displaying the total wages paid by an employer.\r\nA line graph that shows the monthly total wages paid by an employer\r\nover time.\r\n1. Control\r\n\r\n** Please fill in\r\n2. Bar Graph of Total Wages\r\n\r\n** Please fill in.\r\n3. Line Chart of Monthly\r\nTotal Wages\r\n\r\n** Please fill in.\r\nEmployees\r\nHow does the financial health of the residents change over the\r\nperiod covered by the dataset? How do wages compare to the overall cost\r\nof living in Engagement? Are there groups that appear to exhibit similar\r\npatterns? Describe your rationale for your answers. Limit your response\r\nto 10 images and 500 words.\r\n We use 3 sub-tabs to answer\r\nthis - Income and Expense, Patterns with Heatmap and\r\nParticipant Breakdown.\r\nThe ‘Income and Expense’ Tab\r\n\r\nThis has 7 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA line graph for Engagement.\r\nA line graph for an individual.\r\nA violin plot for Engagement.\r\nA violin plot for individual.\r\n1. Control\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are 3 parts to the controller. The first part allows me to\r\nselect the time range, as well as the time divisions (daily, weekly etc)\r\nto be used for evaluation.\r\nThe second one allows us to decide what income and expense to\r\nevaluate for Engagement. On top of that, it allows us to evaluate the\r\ntotal, average, maximum and minimum value for each time division.\r\nThe last one allows the user to evaluate an individual participant’s\r\nincome and expenses. This allows us to either evaluate the individual\r\nalone, or compare him or her to the general performance in\r\nEngagement.\r\n2 + 3. Line Graphs\r\n\r\nThis allows the user to track subtle differences in income, total\r\nexpenses and sub-expenses over time and answers the first 2\r\nsub-questions.\r\n4 + 5. Violin Plots\r\n\r\nWhile the line graph is great, it does not encapsulate any\r\nstatistical information. \r\nWe gather such information for the chosen income and expenses for\r\nboth Engagement and the individual chosen with a violin plot. This way,\r\nwe get to see the distribution, as well as the mean and variance in the\r\ndifferent parameters.\r\nThe ‘Patterns with Heatmap’\r\nTab\r\nThe Patterns with\r\nHeatmap tab has 2 parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nA heatmap representing the balance of individuals in\r\nEngagement.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe controller allows us to choose the date range and the time\r\ndivision to evaluate. In order to seek a “pattern”, we let the user rank\r\nthe participants based on a certain factor. The user can do this\r\nascendingly or descendingly. Lastly, we allow the user to explore\r\ndifferent ranges of people, from the top 50 all the way to the 237th\r\nmember ranked.\r\n2 - Heatmap\r\n\r\nEach row in the heat map represents a participant. Each column in the\r\nheat map represents a time period. To adjust the number of participants\r\nin the heat map, we can use the “Top X filter” in the Heat Map\r\nController. \r\nMore importantly, the magnitude of the colour is representative of\r\nthe amount of balance or debt. For example, a participant with more debt\r\nin a certain time period will have a denser red-coloured grid than a\r\nuser with less debt.\r\nThe ‘Employee Breakdown’ Tab\r\n\r\nThe Employee Breakdown tab has 2 large parts.\r\nThe controller that allows the user to interact with the different\r\nplots and graphs.\r\nMay other barplots that represent the basic traits of the\r\nparticipants chosen in the previous heatmap.\r\n1 - Control\r\n\r\nThe barplots will naturally changes according to the decisions we\r\nmade in the previous heatmap.
