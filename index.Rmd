By day, I am a can of tomato soup. 

By night, we are a group of 3 graduate students, each from disparate fields bounded by our love for data visualisation. Hulwana (right) is a real estate expert, Tiffany (centre) is a security professional and Kim Siang (left) is a software engineer. 

We present our solution for the IEEE Data Visualsation 2022 Challenge - Question 3 in this website, and hope that you will enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed creating it.
