# Introduction

The first of its kind, this termâ€™s ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications course led by Professor Kam Tin Seong builds us towards the highly prestigious IEEE Vast Challenge 2022.

There are 4 challenges provided, targeting different aspects of life in the fictional town Engagement. Our team chose to analyse the Economics of Engagement, and created an interactive dashboard that allows the user to visually analyse the interplay between employee (or residents) and business (or employers) in order to answer the questions: *Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over time?*.

# Data Preparation

This year, the competition features the fictional town Engagement. We are given a total of 13 datasets comprising information from 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2022-03-04T14:25:00Z about the 1010 participants who reside there. The team used 10 of these datasets for this project, and they are **Participant StatusLogs, Apartments, Buildings, Employers, Jobs, Participants, Pubs, Restaurants, Schools and CheckinJournal**.

We performed data wrangling and transformation to the datasets before loading them in the application. Click here for the code to these steps. 

# Methodology

The application uses various packages such as tidyverse, plotly, ggplot2, lubridate, tmap, sf packages to conduct exploratory data analysis. 



# Features
The app consist of three tabs for users to explore the economy of Engagement City; (1) Business Perfomance, (2) Employees and (3) Employers.  

## Tab 1 - 'Business Performance'

In assessing which businesses within the city of Engagement are thriving, we consider two approaches by using the revenue generated and wages offered. Pubs and restaurants are two distinct businesses with participant's expenses data available. As such, the performance of pubs and restaurants are evaluated based on the accumulated sales. On the other hand, as wages are the only numeric data present for all employers, it will be the basis in comparing the prosperity of the businesses.

## Tab 2 - 'Residents'

Or with figures: Figure \@ref(fig:standard-plot), or Figure \@ref(fig:morefigs).

```{r standard-plot, out.width='80%', fig.align='center', fig.cap='Great figure!', fig.height=5}
plot(mtcars[1:2])
```


## Tab 3 - 'Employers'

Upon clicking on the 'Employers' tab, the user can further select 3 components to explore. They are (1) Employment Numbers (2) Hiring Rate and (3) Turnover Rate 



**(1) Overview of Employers' Health** From "Employment Numbers" tab, users can study the employment numbers throughout different time period of all the employers in the city via the reactive map and datatable. The map shows the locations, employer ID, average pay given and number of employees they employed.

**(2) Hiring Rate** From trelliscope, users can filter through the different variables within the chart to explore how the hiring rate varies across different employers at different time period.

**(2) Turnover Rate** This tab zoomed down to residents that have changed jobs and employers that have changed employees during the study period. The charts separate the employees into different education level and highlight their respective joviality. This allows users to generate insights on relations of other factors to turnover rate.

# Future Work and Conclusion
A limitation identified by the team is the lack of data to better assess the health of businesses. Given more information, such as business expenses, it would enable the team to accurately determine the growth of a business by comparing the profits and losses over time.

Try `posterdown` out! Hopefully you like it!
