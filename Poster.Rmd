# Introduction

The first of its kind, this termâ€™s ISSS608 Visual Analytics and Applications course led by Professor Kam Tin Seong builds us towards the highly prestigious IEEE Vast Challenge 2022.

There are 4 challenges provided, targeting different aspects of life in the fictional town Engagement. Our team chose to analyse the Economics of Engagement, and created an interactive dashboard that allows the user to visually analyse the interplay between employee (or residents) and business (or employers) in order to answer the questions: *Over time, are businesses growing or shrinking? How are people changing jobs? Are standards of living improving or declining over time?*

# Data Preparation

This year, the competition features the fictional town Engagement. We are given a total of 13 datasets comprising information from 2022-03-01T00:00:00Z to 2022-03-04T14:25:00Z about the 1010 participants who reside there. The team used 10 of these datasets for this project, and they are **Participant StatusLogs, Apartments, Buildings, Employers, Jobs, Participants, Pubs, Restaurants, Schools and CheckinJournal**.

We performed data wrangling and transformation to the datasets before loading them in the application. 

# Methodology

The application uses various packages such as tidyverse, plotly, ggplot2, lubridate, tmap, sf packages to conduct exploratory data analysis. 


# Features

The app consist of three tabs for users to explore the economy of Engagement City; (1) Business Perfomance, (2) Employees and (3) Employers.  

## Tab 1 - 'Business Performance'

In assessing which businesses within the city of Engagement are thriving, we consider two approaches by using the revenue generated and wages offered. Pubs and restaurants are two distinct businesses with participant's expenses data available. As such, the performance of pubs and restaurants is evaluated based on the accumulated sales. On the other hand, as wages are the only numeric data present for all employers, it will be the basis for comparing the financial prosperity of the employers.
 
Upon clicking on the 'Business Performance' tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) By Revenue and (2) By Wages.

**(1) By Revenue**
Under the `By Revenue` section it is further divided into 2 sub-tabs, `Overview` and `Deep Dive`.

The`Overview` sub-tab provides an overall glance of the business performance of pubs and restaurants. Users first select either pubs or restaurants to see the ranking in terms of overall sales based on the filtered duration. The data found on the right part of the dashboard provides further insights on the sales performance of each business that falls under the selected category of pubs or restaurants arranged based on the average monthly sales in descending order. Users can also observe the monthly trend of each business through the sparklines available. Meanwhile, the map plot illuminates areas of the town where businiesses are flourishing.

The `Deep Dive` section allows user to explore on the sales performance of a selected business across the weekdays. In general, we observe that pubs tend to have higher sales and more visitors during the weekends. On the other hand, the heatmap plot reveals the peak timings of the 'Venue ID' selected.

**(2) By Wages**
Users have the option to compare the average wages of the employers by filtering the education level. The packed bar charts showcase the top employers that offers the 10 highest average hourly wage by education level. The box plot depicts the distribution of the average hourly wage of all employers. User can select the points on the boxplot to obtain additional details of the selected businesses such as the number of jobs offered for that particular education level.

## Tab 2 - 'Employees'

Upon clicking on the 'Employees' tab, the user can further select 3 components to explore. They are (1) Income and Expense, (2) Patterns with Heatmap and (2) Participant Breakdown.


## Tab 3 - 'Employers'

Upon clicking on the 'Employers' tab, the user can further select 2 components to explore. They are (1) Map View and (2) Turnover Rate.

**(1) Overview of Employers' Health** Users can study the employment numbers throughout different time period of all the employers in the city via the map and datatable. The map shows the locations of each employer and number of employees they employed. The statistical plot aims to show the distribution of the number of employees with the user selected variable.

**(2) Turnover Rate** This tab zoomed down to employees that have changed jobs and employers that have changed employees during the 15 month data collection period. The charts separate the employees into different education levels and whether they have kids. The statistical plots aims to allow users to generate insights on relations of other factors to turnover rate.

# Future Work and Conclusion
A limitation identified by the team is the lack of data to better assess the financial health of businesses. Given more information, such as business expenses, it could enable the team to accurately determine the growth of a business by comparing the profits and losses over time.

Try `posterdown` out! Hopefully you like it!
